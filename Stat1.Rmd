## Population 
- Population refers to the entire set of items or objectives that are of interest to a specific study, such as a group of people,
animals, and objectives. 

- Studying the population is a complex task, often challenging and impractical. One reason for that is the size of the 
population. In many real-life cases, the population size is vast, making it time-consuming and challenging to access and collect the required data
from each member of the population. 


## Sample

- Sample is a part (or a subset) of the population. 

- Sample is collected from the population under the study to make inferences about the entire population. 

- Due to sample variability, there will always be a potential for sample error. 

- Sample error refers to the difference between the population and the sample taken from it. 

## Sample techniques

- Sampling techniques can be divided into statistical and non-statistical methods. 

## Non-statistical Sampling method 

- Convenience sampling: 

1- It is a non-probability sampling technique. 
2- The researchers selected the individuals based on their availability and willingness to participate. 
3- It is easy and cost-effective in comparison to other sampling techniques. 
4- Due to the lack of random selection, it may lead to selection bias. 

- Judgment sampling:

1- It is a non-probability sampling technique. 
2- It is based on the researchers' judgment and experiences. 
3- It is cost-effective as the researchers focus on specific groups in this sampling method. 
4- This method may lead to potential bias as it is based on the researcher's judgments, and hence, the selected individuals may influenced by the researcher's bias or pre-concepetions.
