# Population 
- Population simply refers to the entire set of items, or objectives that are of interest to a specific study, such as group of people,
animals, and objectives. 

- Studying the population is not a straightforward task, challenging and impractical for many cases. One reason for that is the size of the 
population. In many real life cases, the population size is huge making it time consuming and difficult to access and collect required data
from each member of the population. 

- Instead of studying the population, we can select a subset of it called sample. 

# Sample

- Sample is part (subset) of the population. 

- Sample is collected from population under the study in aim to make inference about the entire population. 

- Due to variability in samples, there will be always a potential for so-called sample error. 

- Sample error, simply, refers to the difference between the population and the sample taken from it.
