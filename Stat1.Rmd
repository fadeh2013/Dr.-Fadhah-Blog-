# Population and Sample
We call it a population if we are interested in an entire group of people, animals, or items, for example, all high school students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 
If we take part of this population, then this part is called a sample. For example, out of all the high school students in Riyadh, we can select high school students 
in specific schools as a sample for our study.
