One reason for that is the size of the\npopulation. In many real-life cases, the population size is vast, making it time-consuming and challenging to access and collect the required data\nfrom each member of the population.\nSample\nSample is a part (or a subset) of the population.\nSample is collected from the population under the study to make inferences about the entire population.\nDue to sample variability, there will always be a potential for sample error.\nSample error refers to the difference between the population and the sample taken from it.\nSample techniques\nSampling techniques can be divided into statistical and non-statistical methods.\nNon-statistical Sampling method\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n## Convenience sampling:\n=======\n- Convenience sampling:\n1- It is a non-probability sampling technique.\n2- The researchers selected the individuals based on their availability and willingness to participate.\n3- It is easy and cost-effective in comparison to other sampling techniques.\n4- Due to the lack of random selection, it may lead to selection bias.\nJudgment sampling:\n1- It is a non-probability sampling technique.\n2- It is based on the researchers’ judgment and experiences.\n3- It is cost-effective as the researchers focus on specific groups in this sampling method.\n4- This method may lead to potential bias as it is based on the researcher’s judgment, and hence, the selected individuals may influenced by the researcher’s bias or pre-conceptions.\nStatistical Sampling method\nSimple random sample: In simple random sampling, each person/item/subject has an equally likely chance to be selected.\nComing Soon!\n>>>>>>> 090ef32be39e2238487b3700e4837cddcf403172\n1- It is a non-probability sampling technique.\n2- The researchers selected the individuals based on their availability and willingness to participate.\n3- It is easy and cost-effective in comparison to other sampling techniques.\n4- Due to the lack of random selection, it may lead to selection bias.\nJudgment sampling:\n1- It is a non-probability sampling technique.\n2- It is based on the researchers’ judgment and experiences.\n3- It is cost-effective as the researchers focus on specific groups in this sampling method.\n4- This method may lead to potential bias as it is based on the researcher’s judgments, and hence, the selected individuals may influenced by the researcher’s bias or pre-conceptions.\nStatistical Sampling method\n#Simple random sample:\nIn simple random sampling, each person/item/subject has an equally likely chance to be selected.\nComing Soon!\n\n\n\n",
