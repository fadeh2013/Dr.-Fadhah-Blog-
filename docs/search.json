In this page we are interest in the\nhypothesis test for a single mean, such that we are interested in one sample.\nFormulate the hypothesis test\nIn hypothesis test, a researcher needs to formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) and the alternative hypothesis\n(\\(H_a\\)). After that, he/she needs to use a statistical evidence to evaluate which hypothesis is more likely.\nPopulation statndard deviation is known\nIf the population standard deviation is known (\\(\\sigma\\)), or we have a large sample size, then we can use the normal (\\(Z\\)-Statistics).\n\\[Z _\\textit{test} = (\\bar{x} - μ) / (σ / √n)\\]\nWhere:\n\\(z\\) is the z-statistic\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean\n\\(μ\\) is the population mean\n\\(σ\\) is the population standard deviation\n\\(n\\) is the sample size\n\n\n\n",

One reason for that is the size of the\npopulation. In many real-life cases, the population size is vast, making it time-consuming and challenging to access and collect the required data\nfrom each member of the population.\nSample\nSample is a part (or a subset) of the population.\nSample is collected from the population under the study to make inferences about the entire population.\nDue to sample variability, there will always be a potential for sample error.\nSample error refers to the difference between the population and the sample taken from it.\nSample techniques\nSampling techniques can be divided into statistical and non-statistical methods.\nNon-statistical Sampling method\nConvenience sampling:\nIt is a non-probability sampling technique.\nThe researchers selected the individuals based on their availability and willingness to participate.\nIt is easy and cost-effective in comparison to other sampling techniques.\nDue to the lack of random selection, it may lead to selection bias.\nJudgment sampling:\nIt is a non-probability sampling technique.\nIt is based on the researchers’ judgment and experiences.\nIt is cost-effective as the researchers focus on specific groups in this sampling method.\nThis method may lead to potential bias as it is based on the researcher’s judgment, and hence, the selected individuals may influenced by the researcher’s bias or pre-conceptions.\nStatistical Sampling method\nSimple random sample:\nIn simple random sampling, each person/item/subject has an equally likely chance to be selected.\nComing Soon!\n\n\n\n",
