      "contents": "\nHypothesis test\nBasically, a hypothesis test is a statistical method to test a claim, believes or a status quo. In this page we are interest in the\nhypothesis test for a single mean, such that we are interested in one sample.\nFormulate the hypothesis test\nIn hypothesis test, a researcher needs to formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) and the alternative hypothesis\n(\\(H_a\\)). After that, he/she needs to use a statistical evidence to evaluate which hypothesis is more likely.\nPopulation statndard deviation is known\nIf the population standard deviation is known (\\(\\sigma\\)), or we have a large sample size, then we can use the \\(Z\\)-Statistics.\n\\[Z _\\textit{test} = \\frac{(\\bar{x} - μ)} {(σ / √n)}\\]\nWhere:\n\\(z\\) is the z-statistic\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean\n\\(μ\\) is the population mean\n\\(σ\\) is the population standard deviation\n\\(n\\) is the sample size\nExample of using Z-statistics\nFirst of all, suppose we need to test the following hypothesis test:\n\\[H_0: \\mu = 200\\]\n\\[H_a: \\mu \\neq 200\\]\nWith \\[n = 50, \\ \\bar{x} = 197, \\  \\mu = 200, \\ \\sigma = 9, \\ \\alpha = 0.05\\]\nSolution:\nIs the population standard deviation known?\nYes, the population standard deviation is known and given as \\(\\sigma = 9\\).\nCan we use the Z-statistics to test the hypothesis, and why?\nYes. Because if the population standard deviation is known we can use \\(Z\\)-Statistics, also the sample size is large (\\(n \\geq 30\\)).\nHow many rejection area do we have in this case, and why?\nIn this case, there are two rejection areas. Because the alternative hypothesis has unequal sign (“\\(\\neq\\)”). That is,\nthe rejection region are determined based on the sign of the alternative hypothesis.\nOk. If we have two rejection regions, what we should do with the significant level?\nIf we have two rejections areas, then we must divide the significant level (\\(\\alpha\\)) by \\(2\\). That is: \\[\\alpha /2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025\\]\nGreat! What is next?\nNow we need to specify the decision rule, as follows:\nDecision Rule:\nDecision rule is just a decision that we made regarding rejecting or fail to reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)).\nFirst we need to formulate the decision rule. That is, when we reject \\(H_0\\) and when we fail to reject \\(H_0\\).\n_ To formulate the decision rule, a good idea is to draw a graph and to specify the rejection region, as follows:\n\n- From the above graph, we can see that we have two rejection regions. The cut-off (border) of the rejection region start at\n\\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) \\(= 1.96}\\) at the right side, and at \\(- Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) \\(= - 1.96}\\) at the left side. That is, the rejection regions are the red areas.\nGreate! But what does this mean?\nGood questions! Here is the answer:\n(Simply) The rejection region is the area that if the \\(Z\\)-statistics or \\(Z\\)-test fall in, then we need to reject the null hypothesis.\nGreat! What next?\nNow, we need to specify the decision rule. When we reject the \\(H_0\\) and when fail to reject \\(H_0\\) based on the rejection areas as follows:\n\\[ If \\ Z_{test} > Z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96 \\rightarrow \\  Reject \\ H_0\\]\nor\n\\[ If \\ - Z_{test} < - Z_{\\alpha/2} = - 1.96 \\rightarrow \\  Reject \\ H_0\\]\nOtherwise do not reject \\(H_0\\).\nExplaining the Decision rule\n\\[ If \\ Z_{test} > Z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96 \\rightarrow \\  Reject \\ H_0\\]\nThis part of the decision rule said that: If the value of the \\(Z_{test}\\) larger than the right border of the rejection area,\nthen we need to reject the \\(H_0\\).\nOk. But why? That is because it falls inside the rejection area!\nOk. How about the left hand-side? The same situation. That is:\n\\[ If \\ - Z_{test} < - Z_{\\alpha/2} = - 1.96 \\rightarrow \\  Reject \\ H_0\\]\nThis part of the decision rule said that: If the value of the \\(- Z_{test}\\) smaller than the left border of the rejection area,\nthen we need to reject the \\(H_0\\). Because it falls inside the rejection area.\nGreat! So we should compare the Z-test with the critical value.\nThe graph shows the value of the \\(- Z_{test} = -2.36\\). From the graph, the \\(- Z_{test} = -2.36\\) falls inside the left\nrejection area.\nOk. What does this means?\nAs explained above, it means that the \\(- Z_{test} = -2.36\\) is smaller than the \\(- Z_{\\alpha/2} = -1.96\\). In other words, the \\(- Z_{test}\\) is inside the\nrejection region. Hence, based on the decision rule, we need to reject \\(H_0\\).\nNormalConclusion\nBecause the \\(Z_{test} = -2.36\\) is smaller than the \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}= -1.96\\), and hence falls in the rejection region, we reject \\(H_0\\), and conclude that, the population mean is not equal to \\(200\\).\nHow to do it using Statcrunch\n\n\n\n",
