One reason for that is the size of the\npopulation. In many real life cases, the population size is huge making it time consuming and difficult to access and collect required data\nfrom each member of the population.\n=======\nSample\nSample is part (subset) of the population.\nSample is collected from population under the study in aim to make inference about the entire population.\nDue to variability in samples, there will be always a potential for so-called sample error.\nSample error, simply, refers to the difference between the population and the sample taken from it.\nSample technique\nThere are several sampling techniques which can be divided as statistical sampling and non-statistical sampling methods.\nNon-statistical Sampling method\nComming soon.\n\n\n\n",
